# Summary

This is a simple 5G RAN scheduler that uses the `scheduler` environment build using OpenAI Gym [1]. The power consumption model used in this scheduler is described in [2]
and the design of the scheduler is inspired by [3].

# Requirements 

- `python 3.8.5.`
- `gym`
- `numpy`
- `math`

# Installation 
Run inside 5GRANSched folder:

`cd scheduler`

`pip install -e .`

# List of files 

- SchedQL.py runs a simple Q-learning (off-policy) approach that maximizes the RAN energy efficiency by selecting the transmission power per resource block.
- cleanScheduler.bat deletes and re-registers the `scheduler` environment.
